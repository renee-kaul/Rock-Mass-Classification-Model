the project focused on the development of a Machine Learning-based Rock Mass Classification model with an accuracy of 98%, 
to enhance the efficiency of the classification process through automation. The primary objectives were to optimize the accuracy and reliability of rock mass classification, 
thereby reducing the time and cost associated with traditional manual analysis methods. This model aims to provide Geotechnical and Civil Engineers with a robust tool for making 
informed decisions, ultimately improving safety and efficiency by accurately predicting rock mass behavior under various conditions. The integration of advanced machine learning 
algorithms is expected to significantly enhance predictive capabilities and operational performance in geotechnical engineering applications.
